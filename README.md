# DJANGO-Website
This is a simple web app made using DJANGO framework in Python 3. It has a search bar in which you can search any service or item and it will use the 'craigslist' website to show you results i.e their titles, image, and price (if mentioned). It also uses BeautifulSoup for its webscraping.
